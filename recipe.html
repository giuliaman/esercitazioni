<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</strong>

<p>
  <mark>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br></li>
  <li>
    <del>195g</del>
    <ins>175g</ins>
    of tahini<br></li>
  <li>6 sundried tomatoes<br></li>
  <li>Half a red pepper<br></li>
  <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper<br></li>
  <li>1 clove of garlic<br></li>
  <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
  <em>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br> </em>
  <em>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br> </em>
  <em>Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br> </em>
  <em>Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br> </em>
  <em>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br> </em>
  <em>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time </em>
</p>


<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

<em>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</em>
